// USING IOT OF ARDUINO DIGISPARK ATTINY85 TO DO CYBERSECURITY EXPLOITMENTS AND CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS

The project title as “USING IOT OF ARDUINO DIGISPARK ATTINY85 TO DO
CYBERSECURITY EXPLOITMENTS AND CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS”. The use of
an Internet of Things (IoT) device, specifically the Arduino Digispark ATTiny85 USB
development kit, to establish a reverse shell access for remote access from both computers and
Android devices. The paper discusses the technical details of the implementation and the
potential benefits and risks associated with this type of remote access. This project could have
implications for remote access and security in various industries and applications. specifically
the USB development kit Arduino Digispark ATTiny85, to gain remote access through a
reverse shell from both computers and Android devices. The project utilizes the Digispark's
small size and low power consumption to create a covert, easily concealable remote access
tool. By analyzing the design and implementation of the reverse shell system, this paper
highlights the potential risks associated with the misuse of IoT devices, while also showcasing
the versatility and practicality of these devices in remote access scenarios.
